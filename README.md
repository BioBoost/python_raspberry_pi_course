# Python and Raspberry Pi Course

Welcome to this Python and Raspberry Pi Course. This course and workshop are provided to you by VIVES college University in Bruges. Both are part of a PWO project on Internet of Things and LoRaWAN that is currently running at VIVES college University.

This course is still a work in progress and should not be considered final. For the moment it is only available as a draft version.

Remarks and suggestions are greatly appreciated.
