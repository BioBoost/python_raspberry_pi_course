# The TouchBerry Pi Shield

The TouchBerry Pi shield is a shield that can be plugged on top of the Raspberry Pi (2 and 3) and enables a touch interface through 7 capacitive buttons.

Version 2.0 of the shield has the following hardware on board:
* AT42QT1070 I2C capacitive touch sensor IC
* TLC59116 I2C-Bus Constant-Current LED Sink Driver
* 5 RGB LEDs
* 24LC65 64K I2C Smart Serial EEPROM
* MCP9800 2-Wire High-Accuracy Temperature Sensor
* MMA8451QT MEMS Accelerometer, 3-Axis

The schematic of the QT1070 touch sensor and the TLC59116 LED driver is shown below:
