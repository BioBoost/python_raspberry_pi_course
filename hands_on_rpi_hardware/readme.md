# Hands on Raspberry Pi Hardware

The following hands on tutorials guide you through some basic interfacing with hardware. Each guide consists of a hardware setup that needs to be build and a Python script to interact with the hardware. At the end some challenges are presented to encourage you to build upon the current setup.

The following hands on guides are available:
* [Turning on an LED with your Raspberry Pi's GPIO Pins](../hands_on_rpi_hardware/led.md)
* [Using an LDR as a switch on the Raspberry Pi's GPIO Pins](../hands_on_rpi_hardware/ldr.md)
